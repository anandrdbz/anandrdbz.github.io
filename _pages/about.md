Research Summary
======

At the Computational Physics Group, we work on developing developing fast and accurate solutions to numerous problems arising in physics and biology by utilizing state-of-the-art numerical and computational models. These models are often combined with machine learning tools to obtain better predictions. The applications of these numerical solvers range from the biomedical and defense industries to renewable energy industries. In particular, we are currently working on developing MFC, a multi-phase  and multi-component fluid flow solver that also incorporates bubbly flows that is scalabe to some of the largest computing clusters by making use of parallel architecture. We are also working on accelarating the solver by making use of GPUs.
